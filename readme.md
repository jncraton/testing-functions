Testing
=======

A lab experience demonstrating how to create simple tests using Python.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

This experience is targeted toward learners who are new to Python programming and has two distinct learning objectives. After students complete this project, they should be able to:

- Write [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) having no side effects
- Use [assertions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)) to confirm expectations

Task
----

Handout code for this lab is provided in [functions.py](functions.py). Your task is to complete the functions specified such that they pass the included `assert` tests. Finally, you will create your own functions along with your own tests.
